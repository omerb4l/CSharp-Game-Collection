# C# Game Collection  

These projects were developed during the first semester of my second year in the Software Engineering program at Fırat University, under the guidance of **Mr. Cem Baydoğan**. I would like to thank him for his support and direction throughout this process.  

The goal of these projects was to enhance my understanding of basic game mechanics and improve my programming skills in C#.
